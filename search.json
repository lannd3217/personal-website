Frequent absences correlate with lower grades, increased dropout rates, and diminished long-term outcomes. By understanding which factors drive absenteeism, educators and policymakers can design more targeted interventions.\nIn this notebook, I analyze records from seven schools over seven academic years. My overarching goal is to identify patterns and predictors of chronic absenteeism, with the ultimate aim of guiding effective attendance-improvement strategies."

    "text": "Motivation\nStudent attendance is more than just a line item in school administrative data. It’s linked to:\n\nAcademic Achievement: Students who attend school regularly often see better test scores and improved GPAs.\n\nEquity Considerations: Certain demographic groups (e.g., English Learners, low-income students) might face unique challenges that affect attendance.\n\nResource Allocation: Understanding absenteeism helps schools allocate counselors, attendance monitors, and program funding more effectively.\n\nLong-Term Impact: Chronic absenteeism in earlier grades can ripple through a student’s educational trajectory, potentially influencing high school completion and college readiness.\n\nBy examining variables such as attendance rates, days enrolled, demographic details, and special program status, I seek to paint a clearer picture of how these features interrelate and what they reveal about absenteeism trends."

This raises questions about the underlying causes (further research on how schools report days enrolled may be necessary). We may also need to reconsider the definition of chronic absenteeism (where the ratio of days absent to days enrolled is greater than 10%), as low values for days enrolled could disproportionately impact the chronic absenteeism rate."

Upon examining records with TBD, we find that these are primarily new enrollees. For students who reappear in subsequent years, their Fluency values are recorded in later years. Based on this insight, I fill Unknown or TBD entries in Fluency with matching values from other records with the same ANON_ID. After this process, 68 TBD and 2 Unknown entries remain, representing students who appear only once in the dataset—likely indicating that they did not re-enroll. Even though these students account for only 3% of the dataset, they still provide valuable information in other variables, such as Attendance Rate, SED, SpEd, etc. Therefore, I’ve decided to retain these records rather than dropping them. However, to simplify our model, I will consolidate TBD and Unknown into a single label, Unknown, in the Fluency column. This will help reduce model complexity while preserving the information these records offer.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANON_ID\nBirthdate\nGen\nEth\nFluency\nSpEd\nGrade\nAttRate\nDaysEnr\nDaysAbs\nSusp\nCurrWeightedTotGPA\nSED\nSchool\nYear\nAge\nChroAbs\n\n\n\n\n4662\n78297\n2004-11-24\nM\nLatino\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n10\n0.9892\n93.0\n1.0\nNaN\n3.63\nNot SED\nCastlemont\n21-22\n17\n0\n\n\n4663\n78298\n2004-11-24\nM\nLatino\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n10\n0.9892\n93.0\n1.0\nNaN\n3.63\nNot SED\nCastlemont\n21-22\n17\n0\n\n\n5159\n44057\n2008-01-15\nF\nLatino\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n9\n0.5122\n41.0\n20.0\nNaN\n0.00\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n22-23\n14\n1\n\n\n12481\n5911\n2009-10-17\nF\nLatino\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n7\n0.7385\n65.0\n17.0\nNaN\n3.00\nUnknown\nElmhurst United\n22-23\n13\n1\n\n\n15905\n50958\n2014-03-23\nM\nWhite\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n1\n0.9063\n64.0\n6.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNot SED\nMLK\n21-22\n7\n0\n\n\n20077\n31810\n2017-02-25\nM\nNot Reported\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n-1\n0.0833\n12.0\n11.0\nNaN\nNaN\nSED\nPrescott\n21-22\n4\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANON_ID\nBirthdate\nGen\nEth\nFluency\nSpEd\nGrade\nAttRate\nDaysEnr\nDaysAbs\nSusp\nCurrWeightedTotGPA\nSED\nSchool\nYear\nAge\nChroAbs\n\n\n\n\n4662\n78297\n2004-11-24\nM\nLatino\nUnknown\nNot Special Ed\n10\n0.9892\n93.0\n1.0\nNaN\n3.63\nNot SED\nCastlemont\n21-22\n17\n0\n\n\n5571\n78297\n2004-11-24\nM\nLatino\nEL\nNot Special Ed\n11\n0.9056\n180.0\n17.0\nNaN\n3.43\nSED\nCastlemont\n22-23\n18\n0\n\n\n6442\n78297\n2004-11-24\nM\nLatino\nEL\nNot Special Ed\n12\n0.8833\n180.0\n21.0\nNaN\n2.40\nSED\nCastlemont\n23-24\n19\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\n\n\nFluency\n\n\n\n\n\nEO\n10638\n\n\nEL\n8308\n\n\nRFEP\n2683\n\n\nIFEP\n266\n\n\nTBD\n68\n\n\nUnknown\n2\n\n\n\n\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of TBD and Unknown left in the dataset:  0.0031868882312770315\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANON_ID\nBirthdate\nGen\nEth\nFluency\nSpEd\nGrade\nAttRate\nDaysEnr\nDaysAbs\nSusp\nCurrWeightedTotGPA\nSED\nSchool\nYear\nAge\nChroAbs\n\n\n\n\n8\n870\n2000-12-23\nM\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n9\n0.8761\n113.0\n14.0\n0.0\n1.82\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n17-18\n17\n1\n\n\n52\n3933\n2002-12-27\nF\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n9\n0.9344\n122.0\n8.0\n0.0\n2.94\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n17-18\n15\n0\n\n\n53\n3936\n2002-11-16\nM\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n9\n0.9426\n122.0\n7.0\n0.0\n1.76\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n17-18\n15\n0\n\n\n201\n14335\n2000-03-04\nM\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n9\n0.6889\n45.0\n14.0\n0.0\n0.00\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n17-18\n17\n1\n\n\n251\n17703\n2001-01-22\nM\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n9\n1.0000\n9.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.00\nUnknown\nCastlemont\n17-18\n16\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n20067\n26375\n2016-11-21\nF\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n-1\n0.8788\n33.0\n4.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNot SED\nPrescott\n21-22\n5\n1\n\n\n20068\n26376\n2016-12-21\nF\nLatino\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n-1\n0.8788\n33.0\n4.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNot SED\nPrescott\n21-22\n5\n1\n\n\n20548\n35013\n2006-06-15\nM\nNot Reported\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n6\n0.6667\n6.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.00\nUnknown\nWOMS\n17-18\n11\n1\n\n\n20549\n35015\n2003-11-02\nF\nNot Reported\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n7\n0.6667\n6.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.00\nUnknown\nWOMS\n17-18\n14\n1\n\n\n20904\n1962\n2007-11-02\nM\nAsian\nTBD\nNot Special Ed\n6\n1.0000\n5.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.00\nNot SED\nWOMS\n19-20\n12\n0\n\n\n\n\n68 rows × 17 columns\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\n\n\nFluency\n\n\n\n\n\nEO\n10638\n\n\nEL\n8308\n\n\nRFEP\n2683\n\n\nIFEP\n266\n\n\nUnknown\n70\n\n\n\n\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nSED\nFrom the Theil’s U correlation heatmap in section 2, I observed a strong predictive relationship between Year and SED. In this section, I’ll explore the reason behind this relationship. By plotting the distribution of SED values across different years, I found that in the two school years 2017-18 and 2018-19, SED values were consistently labeled as Unknown. This finding aligns with the observed relationship between Year and SED in the heatmap.\nUpon further investigation, examining students with Unknown values in SED revealed a pattern: these students often have this column filled with meaningful information in the following school years. Following this pattern, I applied the same process to fill in Unknown values for SED where possible. Although some Unknown values remain, we can retain these records as they still contribute valuable information to other variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicates and Irrelevant: Before and After\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: After modifying the Fluency and SED columns, I observed that Fluency retains its predictive power on Chronic Absenteeism, while SED shows a significant decrease in predictive strength (dropping from 0.0035 to 0.00035). One possible reason is that replacing Unknown values in SED diluted the relationship between Year and SED—since school years 2017-18 and 2018-19 no longer consist exclusively of Unknown values, SED no longer inherits the predictive power of Year on Chronic Absenteeism (where Year has the strongest predictive power).\nAdditionally, after transforming GPA into the categorical variable Academic Status, the heatmap now includes this new variable. Academic Status shows a strong predictive power on Chronic Absenteeism, with a correlation of 0.05, second only to Year. This aligns with the Pearson correlation heatmap observation where GPA and Attendance Rate had a strong correlation. Furthermore, Academic Status exhibits moderate predictive power on School, likely because elementary schools (covering grades -1 to 5) only have Unknown values in Academic Status."
